I would prefer this over S24 ultra. Used both phones and impressed by this phone. Yes I agree s24 ultra had few more features but in terms of quality 15 pro max wins. And camera quality is far better than s24ultra. But it differs on a customer‚Äôs choice.
"A phone that screams that you are doing very well for yourself. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it works extremely well and I am completely satisfied with it. but, it is way too expensive for a phone. I have a pixel 8 which as a secondary phone which costs way less and I am satisfied with that as well. Nevertheless, nothing can replace an iPhone for me due to personal preferences"
"Wow, such a great phone, superfast, great performance, great camera, great looks"
The phone is really good it had some overheating issue as heard but not faced any it was due to software update now it is all fixed I still did not had any issue regarding overheating. The phone is really fast and the battery life is awesome. The new action button is really handy and useful. The camera is the best camera an iPhone ever had the photos are stunning and spectacular‚Ä¶. I am satisfied with the phone..
"I recently upgraded to the Apple 15 Pro Max, and while the enhanced camera is undoubtedly impressive, but I feel that it falls short of delivering a truly groundbreaking experience. If you're already using the 13 pro or 14 Pro, there seems to be little incentive to make the leap.The camera improvements are noteworthy, capturing detail and clarity like never before. However, beyond this feature, the 15 Pro Max doesn't offer a significant leap in terms of innovation. Personally, I find the Pro versions more manageable in hand, and the Max variant, although boasting a larger screen, can be a bit unwieldy.In essence, the 15 Pro Max is a solid device with a stellar camera, but for those already enjoying the perks of the previous Pro models, the upgrade might not feel as compelling."

"As I was aware that what I need and what I was paying for, I needed a quality mobile with best hardware and software combination.I need the OS to be clean without any bloatware which I got.I don't play games. For moderate use of Social media, whatsapp, youtube, audible (audio books), music while exercising, Battery life is around 2 days or sometimes more than 2 days. If you are a gamer or use mobile a lot you might need to charge your mobile everyday.Camera is good. So far the pictures I took the quality is good.Not explore the processor's capacity yet but Never hanged or never will for me (not a heavy user so won't be a problem)."
The box had a different colour. I order black Titanium....box was black Titanium but phone was natural titanium inside ...It's heart wrenching...Trust shaken...The phone looks usedIt can happen with Apple product also...it's a shock.
"Camera setting not available, so photos not better than Samsung m34, likely Caller tune should not set, call record not available. Should not connect to laptop. Download space not available"
Packing is bad. There's a tampered package within a new package. The tampered package contained the phone. But the phone is looking good
Camera quality is best

Hitting problem watching video and charging
"It‚Äôs a fantastic phone‚Ä¶the feel and comfort in hand is awesome‚Ä¶looks stunning‚Ä¶also the brand appeal of Apple is fabulous. Camera is the best, performance is over the top‚Ä¶really fast and the games you can play are of play station‚Äôs‚Ä¶can any other phone do that‚Ä¶also the video quality is very nice‚Ä¶"
It‚Äôs a great buy. I upgraded from XS Max and am so glad I decided to get this. It‚Äôs pricey but worth it. Very powerful battery too
It‚Äôs around 2months I have been using this device and it has been working flawlessly. No heating issues or such. Totally worth the upgrade because of the camera.

This is my 1 st pro iPhone. And so far I‚Äôm really impressed with the performance and simplicity of the product.
"We have received the iPhone 15 Pro Max, natural titanium color, and 256 GB storage capacity. The phone is good-looking and fast. It gets charged with the Apple 20W USB-C Power Adapter (purchased separately). It also charges well using my 3-year-old Mi wireless charger (Qi charging). Overall, we are happy with the iPhone."

I have purchased natural titanium and it's really awesome. My first phone purchased with my hardwork.
No heating issue till now running well with the new software update I have installed lots of apps and the ph is running well
Play VideoDidn't use a screen guard for a week and found a scratch on the screen. What a stupid phone. 160k phone and you will get a scratch without even holding the phone. Better get a screen guard the day you receive the phone.
Got a defective product where the camera doest load
"box damaged, no new device smell. Completely ruined my unboxing experience. But the phone is amazing."
This Phone is like the Central processing unit (CPU) with a screen. It is fast as thunder and got heated like lava after using it for sometime. Camera is better than reflection of mirror and it's screen and overall body is weaker than a mirror i.e. it breaks easily.
"A17 Pro , 3Nm ,Ray tracing , 5x zoom nailed it completely. A truly freaking flagship mobile so far. iOs 18 will make it more powerful."
15 pro max >>>> all androids . the speed the camera the new ios justtt superbthe resident evil village runs so smoothly
Overpriced. It should not cost more than 1.1L. Bought it at 1.6L viz 50K extra I felt. Go for 15 instead of pro max. Overhyped phone this one is
"Accha hai bass aur kya bolu.Haa kabhi lag karta hai,Aur thoda expensive bhi hai.Thanks for watching and future review bhi aate rahenge"
If at all looking for pro model just because of lidar and action button and camera. Its not value for money as the charging and performance are not upto the mark for both pro and non pro models. I purchased iPhone 15 pro 128gb not happy
"Iphone always the better than Android , I need the iphone please give me one Amazon please amazon Amazon Amazon"
Heats very much during charger. Even if apple type c charger is used.No much difference from 14 pro max.
"If you already have 14 Pro or Pro Max then don't upgrade, but if you've any other Pro or non Pro models go for it. If you need an iPhone with 24-26hr battery life on a single charge then go for Pro Max models. No doubt Apple's 4K 60fps ProRes is really awesome, and the all new type-c port is the best thing Apple has done in years. Also all the type-c cables included in the box are woven design, now expecting this will not turn grey after few months of use."
"We Know Nowadays There was so much hate spreading on Iphone 15 Series But as i am a techie, i know most of the critics had never used and talking like trash bin. i Using From Past 1 month, If You Love Photography Or Pro-Gaming then you are good to take this smartphone. Just Dont Care The Criticism.I Too Had Feel The Phone Is warm while heavy gaming and Photography, But was never like what had they said in news. I Loved The Photos The Phone Gives."
No heating issue. Even if they exists for you. Use phone on battery saver mode amazing performance Very good phone.

When you hold this phone in your hand then only you can realise feeling of holding a premium phone üçé
